QUESTIONS
What do they mean when they say that due to covid they may not have some items available, does that mean that they may not be able
to make items that are currently on the site? If so, how do you notify the potential customer that the product isn't available?

Are they okay with recieving order details in the form of an email?

How do refunds work?

TIPS
Look at other ecommerce checkouts to see how they implement the process.
